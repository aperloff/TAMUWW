 Hi Ricardo,

Have a look at

/cdf/home/trj/forbernd_sep18_2009.tgz

combocls5.C computes discovery p-values, reseeding the random number generator on each
job segment and printing out -2lnQ values (see the single top PRD).

For definitions, see the PRD:

sec. IX.

For Markov chain limits, make an empty directory, set up cdfsoft2, cd to the empty directory, and type

cvs co mclimit

apologies for the large volume of H->tautau rootfiles Pierluigi gave me last summer.  Should still fit on
most disks (only <300 Mb).

The routine is tcbayes.C -- look for instances of bayes_heinrich or bayeslimit_mcmc1.  There are similar
cross section fitters:  bh_xsfit, bh_xsfit2d, and cross section fitters which say mcmc1 in them.  A lot of the
tcbayes.C lines of code are for a Markov chain calculator Nils wrote, which required some tuning steps
and which didn't always agree exactly with bayes_heinrich, so I wrote the *mcmc1* routines.

Good luck!

Tom
